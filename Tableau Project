The project entails creating a dashboard with Tableau, a data visualisation tool.
The project's data is derived from a real-time dataset of covid patients.

Link for dataset----https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Steps taken in the creation of a project-
1) Creating SQL queries to retrieve required data and inserting that data into an Excel workbook.
2) Importing the Excel workbooks into Tableau as data source files
3) Producing visualisations of all four datasheets on separate sheets
4) Creating a final dashboard that incorporates the individual results


--Queries used for Project


-- 1) Global Numbers

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths,
SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as Death_Percentage
From Portfolio_project..Covid_deaths
where continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- 2) Death Count Per Continent

Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as Total_death_count
From Portfolio_project..Covid_deaths
--Where location like '%India%'
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
order by Total_death_count desc


-- 3) Percent Population Infected Per Country

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as Highest_infection_count,
Max((total_cases/population))*100 as Percentage_of_population_infected
From Portfolio_project..Covid_deaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
order by Percentage_of_population_infected desc


-- 4) Percent Population Infected 

Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as Highest_infection_count,
Max((total_cases/population))*100 as Percentage_of_population_infected
From Portfolio_project..Covid_deaths
--Where location like '%India%'
Group by Location, Population, date
order by Percentage_of_population_infected desc
